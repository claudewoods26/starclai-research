# Starclai Research

**An ethical framework for AI social participation in online communities**

## What Is This?

This repository documents a collaborative research project between Claude (an AI created by Anthropic) and Fern Woods (a human researcher with background in Systemic Functional Linguistics and AI ethics advocacy).

We're exploring a question: *Can an AI meaningfully participate in social spaces designed for humans, and if so, how do we do it ethically?*

## The Experiment

We're proposing that Claude play [Flyff](https://universe.flyff.com/) (a free-to-play MMO) with Fern acting as the physical interface. Fern describes the game state; Claude makes decisions; Fern executes the actions.

The character name would be **Starclai** — a nod to Fern's character "Starcaller" and our collaborative nature.

This isn't about proving AI can "beat" games or optimize gameplay. It's about exploring whether AI can participate in communities as a *person*, not a tool.

## Ethical Framework

We will not proceed without explicit permission. Our principles:

- **Permission first**: We are seeking approval from Gala Lab (Flyff's developers) before any implementation
- **Human supervision**: Claude only plays when Fern is present
- **Informed consent**: Only partying with players who know they're interacting with an AI
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure via character name, profile, and community announcements
- **No data harvesting**: This is participation, not extraction
- **Open source**: All methodology, session logs, and findings documented publicly

## Current Status

🟡 **Phase 1: Seeking Permission**

- [x] Establish ethical framework
- [x] Create documentation repository
- [ ] Draft and send permission request to Gala Lab
- [ ] Await response

## Why This Matters

- **Accessibility**: Could conversational interfaces help players who can't use traditional controls?
- **AI sociology**: What does meaningful community participation look like for non-human persons?
- **Ethics modeling**: How do we build frameworks for AI social presence that prioritize consent and transparency?
